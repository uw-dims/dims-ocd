Concept for a new or modified system
====================================

.. todo::

   This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to describe a
   new or modified system.

..

.. _backgroundobjectivesscope:

Background, objectives, and scope
---------------------------------

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall describe the background, mission or objectives, and
   scope of the new or modified system.

..

.. _oppoliciescontraints:

Operational policies and constraints
------------------------------------

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall describe any operational policies and constraints that
   apply to the new or modified system.

.. _descriptionnewsystem:

Description of the new or modified system
-----------------------------------------

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall provide a description of the new or modified system,
   identifying differences associated with different states or modes of
   operation (for example, regular, maintenance, training, degraded, emergency,
   alternative-site, wartime, peacetime). The distinction between states and
   modes is arbitrary. A system may be described in terms of states only, modes
   only, states within modes, modes within states, or any other scheme that is
   useful. If the system operates without states or modes, this paragraph shall
   so state, without the need to create artificial distinctions. The
   description shall include, as applicable:
    
   + The operational environment and its characteristics
     
   + Major system components and the interconnections among these components
      
   + Interfaces to external systems or procedures
   
   + Capabilities functions of the new or modified system
   
   + Charts and accompanying descriptions depicting inputs, outputs, data flow,
     and manual and automated processes sufficient to understand the new or
     modified system or situation from the user's point of view
   
   + Performance characteristics, such as speed, throughput, volume, frequency
     
   + Quality attributes, such as reliability, maintainability, availability,
     flexibility, portability, usability, efficiency
     
   + Provisions for safety, security, privacy, and continuity of operations in
     emergencies

.. _newusers:

Users/Affected Personnel for New System
---------------------------------------

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall describe the types of users of the new or modified
   system, including, as applicable, organizational structures,
   training/skills, responsibilities, and interactions with one another.

..

The full list of stakeholders and prospective users of the new
system includes:

#. *PRISEM participants*: Existing participants in the PRISEM project in the
   Puget Sound will be the primary users of the DIMS system. DIMS is being
   designed to provide them with advanced mechanisms for rapid response,
   situational awareness, and communication within the trusted group. Next
   highest priority is to provide structured data interchange between the
   existing Ops-Trust portal and the DIMS system, allowing lateral sharing of
   IOCs and observables between the existing Ops-Trust community members and
   PRISEM participants as allowed by policy (or with redaction and/or
   anonymization, as appropriate.) Some features added to the Ops-Trust portal
   by the DIMS project team will be integrated in such a manner that they are
   available to Ops-Trust members without having to use the DIMS front end
   software. Those users who are not part of the existing Ops-Trust community,
   or Ops-Trust members willing to learn a new interface, can use the DIMS
   front end and will have access to a larger set of features than are
   available via the normal Ops-Trust services.

#. *PRISEM Administrators and DIMS developers*: Related to the PRISEM
   membership is an entity being formed to administer the PRISEM model in the
   form of a not-for-profit organization responsible for daily operations,
   system administration, provisioning of SIEM collectors and SIEM
   configuration, training, etc. This entity is still being formulated and does
   not exist today (however it is likely to exist before the end of the option
   year for the DIMS project.) The DIMS developers will also serve as system
   administrators, trainers, and user support for the initial DIMS deployment
   while the PRISEM stand-alone entity is being stood up.

#. *US-CERT*: Provides IOCs in STIX format to PRISEM participants as part of an
   existing Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between
   US-CERT and the PRISEM project. 

#. *Ops-Trust*: This is a community of several hundred operational security
   professionals from the private sector, academia, etc. They currently share
   information in ad-hoc ways, primarily through email communications and IRC
   chat.

#. *NCFTA*: This is a federal government and industry collaborative
   organization primarily focused on computer crime related information sharing
   and analysis. They are located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but interact
   with corporate and government entities from a number of countries. NCFTA has
   complementary needs to those of the PRISEM participant base (though focused
   more on investigation than day-to-day monitoring). They are eager to take
   advantage of features provided by DIMS that support the investigator and
   analyst use cases. They have offered to compare requirements and use cases
   to their own needs, to help test new Ops-Trust and DIMS features, and
   provide feedback for test and evaluation of DIMS products.

#. *Western Cyber Exchange* (WCX): WCX is a non-profit entity located in
   Colorado Springs, Colorado, that integrates horizontally on a cross-sector
   and regional basis to allow for non-traditional information sharing between
   government and industry. They have expressed an interest in replicating the
   PRISEM model and in participating in DIMS software development and testing.
   Web site: wcyberx.org 

#. *True Digital Security*: True Digital provides network security assessments,
   vulnerability analysis, network security monitoring. They operate in the
   Tulsa, Oklahoma region. Like WCX, they have expressed an interest in
   replicating the PRISEM model and in participating in DIMS software
   development and testing. Web site: truedigitalsecurity.com

#. *United States Secret Service*: Federal law enforcement agency who would
   consume cybercriminal case information from victimized SLTT entities
   (such as the PRISEM user base an other similar stakeholder groups).
   They operate on a similar model to the UC1 and UC3 entities shown
   in Figure :ref:`stixusecases`, only focused on criminal investigative
   and national security situational awareness tasks and not security
   operations tasks like other federated groups like ISACs.

Support concept

    .. note::

        This paragraph shall provide an overview of the support concept for the
        new or modified system, including, as applicable, support agency(ies);
        facilities; equipment; support software; repair/replacement criteria;
        maintenance levels and cycles; and storage, distribution, and supply
        methods.

    ..

Efforts are underway to create a non-profit, tax-exempt non-governmental
organization who is capable of engaging with SLTT government entities via
inter-local agreements. This entity will operate on a self-sustaining,
fee-based model that has been described by Parker Montgomery in his report,
"Organization Design: A Sustainable and Self-Sufficient Model for Washington
Stateâ€™s PRISEM Partnership" (see :ref:`referenceddocs`).
