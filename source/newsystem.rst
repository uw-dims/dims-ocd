Description of the new or modified system
-----------------------------------------

.. todo::

   This paragraph shall provide a description of the new or modified system,
   identifying differences associated with different states or modes of
   operation (for example, regular, maintenance, training, degraded, emergency,
   alternative-site, wartime, peacetime). The distinction between states and
   modes is arbitrary. A system may be described in terms of states only, modes
   only, states within modes, modes within states, or any other scheme that is
   useful. If the system operates without states or modes, this paragraph shall
   so state, without the need to create artificial distinctions. The
   description shall include, as applicable:
    
   + The operational environment and its characteristics
     
   + Major system components and the interconnections among these components
      
   + Interfaces to external systems or procedures
   
   + Capabilities functions of the new or modified system
   
   + Charts and accompanying descriptions depicting inputs, outputs, data flow,
     and manual and automated processes sufficient to understand the new or
     modified system or situation from the user's point of view
   
   + Performance characteristics, such as speed, throughput, volume, frequency
     
   + Quality attributes, such as reliability, maintainability, availability,
     flexibility, portability, usability, efficiency
     
   + Provisions for safety, security, privacy, and continuity of operations in
     emergencies
